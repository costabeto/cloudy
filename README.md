![Main screen preview](https://github.com/doravantebeto/cloudy/blob/master/cloudy.gif?raw=true)
  

## Install

  

```sh
yarn
```
or
```sh
npm install
```

  

## Usage

  

```sh
yarn android
```
or
```sh
npm run android
```

## Important

In way to provide a better experience, i used these two APIs in order to get precisely the user location and fetch the weather data of the current location:
- # [OpenCage Geocoder](https://opencagedata.com/)
- # [OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org/)
Both APIs can be used by getting a free API key by registering on their website.

To use your API keys, just place them in:
`
src\config\api.ts
`

And the file must be like:
```sh
const  weatherKey  =  'OpenWeather API Key';
const  geolocationKey  =  'OpenCage Geocode API Key';
export {weatherKey, geolocationKey};
```

## Run tests 

```sh
yarn test
```
